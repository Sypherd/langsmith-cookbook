# Tracing your code

Tracing allows for seamless debugging and improvement of your LLM applications. Here's how:


- [Tracing without LangChain](./traceable/tracing_without_langchain.ipynb): learn to trace applications independent of LangChain using the Python SDK's @traceable decorator.
- [REST API](./rest/rest.ipynb): get acquainted with the REST API's features for logging LLM and chat model runs, and understand nested runs. The run logging spec can be found in the [LangSmith SDK repository](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langsmith-sdk/blob/main/openapi/openapi.yaml).
- [Customizing Run Names](./runnable-naming/run-naming.ipynb): improve UI clarity by assigning bespoke names to LangSmith chain runsâ€”includes examples for chains, lambda functions, and agents.
- [Tracing Nested Calls within Tools](./nesting-tools/nest_runs_within_tools.ipynb): include all nested tool subcalls in a single trace by using `run_manager.get_child()` and passing to the child `callbacks`
